pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # This will use an Ubuntu-based build agent

steps:
# Step 1: Set up Python version (e.g., Python 3.x)
- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.x'  # Specify the Python version, you can use '3.x' or '3.9' for instance
    addToPath: true  # Ensures Python is added to PATH for subsequent steps

# Step 2: Install dependencies from your custom 'dependencies.txt' (previously requirements.txt)
- script: |
    pip install -r dependencies.txt  # Installing dependencies from your custom text file
  displayName: 'Install Dependencies from dependencies.txt'

# Step 3: Static code analysis with Flake8
- script: |
    pip install flake8  # Install flake8 for static code analysis
    flake8 .  # Run flake8 on your project directory to check code style issues
  displayName: 'Run Static Code Analysis with Flake8'

# Step 4: Run Unit Tests with pytest and Track Code Coverage
- script: |
    pip install pytest  # Install pytest for unit testing
    pip install coverage  # Install coverage for code coverage analysis
    coverage run -m pytest  # Run the tests and track code coverage
    coverage report  # Print coverage results to the console
  displayName: 'Run Unit Tests with pytest and Track Code Coverage'

# Step 5: Publish code coverage results (for Azure DevOps UI integration)
- task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@1
  inputs:
    codeCoverageTool: 'Python'  # Specify the tool to use (coverage.py)
    summaryFileLocation: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/coverage.xml'  # Path to the generated coverage.xml
    reportDirectory: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'  # Directory to store the results
  displayName: 'Publish Code Coverage Results'

# Step 6: Publish test results (for Azure DevOps UI integration)
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  inputs:
    testResultsFiles: '**/test-*.xml'  # Pattern for test result files (adjust path if needed)
    testRunTitle: 'Unit Tests Results'
  displayName: 'Publish Unit Test Results'
